# mandelbrotviewer

Java program that plots the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The GUI was created manually, using Swing components. The main classes of interest within this are: <b>ComplexNumber</b> - a custom data type that uses two doubles as a representation of complex numbers, <b>MandelbrotSet</b> - an object that contains data and methods allowing for the generation of a fractal image and <b>FractalDiagram</b> - an object which creates BufferedImages based on the information calculated within MandelbrotSet.

## Getting started

To run this program, the Java development kit is needed (only tested to work on versions 8 and 10)
